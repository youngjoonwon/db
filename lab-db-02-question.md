### Trying basics

#### Question: Put the following three queries into a single sql file (in order): *yourname-db-lab-02.sql*

- Query #1: show all book titles where its rating is greater than 4.0 (inclusive).

- Query #2: show the first 3 books where its format is 'hardcover'

- Query #3: show how many books are published between 2022-01-01 and 2022-12-31 (inclusive).

- In ***yourname-db-lab02.sql***,

  ```sql
  use lab;
  SELECT 'NAME LAB-02' as 'INFO'; /* e.g.) SELECT 'Youngjoon Won LAB-02' as 'INFO'; */
  /* query #1 */
  select ...
  /* query #2 */
  select ...
  ```

**Be very careful!**

- Submit it to LMS, sql file only (db-lab-02). Check the deadline!
- DO NOT put any space in your submit file name. e.g.) 'young  db-lab02 .sql' (X). 0 will be given.
- If your query shows any error, 0 will be given.
